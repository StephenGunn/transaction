# Transaction, A resource for rendering and sending transactional emails with Svelte

Transaction is a resource for learning how to render [
https://svelte.dev
](Svelte) components as email friendly markup on the server along with best practices and integrations with the top email sending clients.

The goal of this project is not to provide an opaque library for rendering emails but to provide a resource for learning how to render emails with Svelte and send them with the top email sending clients.

## Svelte Ready Templates

Along with tutorials on how to render emails with Svelte, this project will also provide a collection of ready to use Svelte templates for common transactional emails based on [Postmark Transactional Email Templates](https://github.com/ActiveCampaign/postmark-templates).

The templates we use will feature their styles not inlined but in their `<style>` tag for ease of maintenance and readability. We will programatically inline their styles before sending them with the email sending clients.

## The Templates

These are all sourced from the [Postmark Transactional Email Templates](https://github.com/ActiveCampaign/postmark-templates) and used under the MIT license.

Each template comes in three different generic layout variations: Basic, Basic full, and Plain. This gives you a starting point so that you can customize your templates to match your brand.

### Comment notification

Notify users of new comments by other users.

**Note:** Comment notification isn't the prettiest preview because it's just [Mustachio](https://github.com/activecampaign/mustachio). Since almost all content in this email is dynamic, it won't look good without real content. Don't worry though, that's how it's supposed to look.
